## Overview

The dataset is about hotel bookings, and it contains data from three years of daily observations of resort and city hotels from 2015 to 2017. There are 119390 rows and 36 columns in this dataset. This dataset contains multiple rows and columns that detail how many children, both adults and newborns, visited a resort and a city hotel, as well as the dates on which they checked in and out, as well as where they came from and what payment method they used. What types of rooms and meals were offered at the city and resort hotels in this case? It also provides information on how many individuals cancelled and how many people returned to both hotels, which we will use to make predictions.
